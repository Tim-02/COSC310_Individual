# Individual Project

In this project I added two more APIs to make interactions with ChatBot more interesting. Instead of returning default responses like "I didn't quite get that" now it can query public APIs for useful information.

## Added APIs

- Wikipedia API
- Flickr API

## Updated documentation

I added more diagrams to [Documentation](./Documentations) folder, as well as updated the Readme file inside.
Just to be safe I have similar information in PDF submitted to Canvas.

Below you can find initial README information of the group project.

### Project Description  

Our goal is to make a Gym Helpline agent. A user may have a variety of questions about a gym and we hope the agent may act as a supplement to a “Frequently Asked Questions” page. Information provided by the agent can be one of several simple topics, such as, available trainers, equipment provided, opening and closing hours and other services provided by the gym. This will allow the gym to provide answers to potential clients without having one or more human agents on call at times. 

### Documentation

All documentation, descriptions of additions for Assignment 3 and screenshots for documentation can be found in the documentation folder of this repository, as well as listed within the ReadMe in the documentation folder.
